# Bachelors Thesis

Topic: Sensorless Field Oriented Control of a Brushless DC Motor

This thesis was written at the Czech Technical University in the department of Circuit Theory.

The Goals of the thesis were

1. Select a suitable combination of a microcontroller and power electronics.
2. Design the controlling electronics and a printed circuit board.
3. Design and implement the controlling algorithm for the estimation of the rotor angle and the field oriented control.

The PCBs and Schematics were designed in Altium. All footprints, symbols and 3D models were manually created.

My supervisor encouraged me to tightly layout the PCB and use small footprints, the smallest being 0402 packages, this was also a challange to solder.

In this repositary following has been attached

1. Code
2. Schematics
3. Boards views
4. Images
5. The Thesis Document.

The Code was written in Microchip studio using C. I have included my code but the not USB library since its not my property.
 
I wanted to split the code up into seperate libraries but this obvisouly did not happen, so please excuse the mess.

The graphs and data seen in the document were created in MATLAB

The motor and magnetic mount were created in SketchUp 3D

Note:
1. The 3D view in the Boardview directory should by opened in Adobe. Github and Chrome does not support 3D PDF models.
