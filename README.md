# Bachelors Thesis

Sensorless Field Oriented Control of a Brushless DC Motor

This thesis was written at the Czech Technical University at the department of Circuit Theory.

The Goals of the thesis were

1: Select a suitable combination of a microcontroller and power electronics.
2: Design the controlling electronics and a printed circuit board.
3: Design and implement the controlling algorithm for the estimation of the rotor angle and the field oriented control.

The PCBs and Schematics were desgined in Altium. All footprints, symbols and 3D models were manually created.

My supervisor encouraged me to tightly layout the PCB and use small components, the smallest footprints were 0402's which were a challange to solder.

In this repositary I have attached the Code, Schematics, Boards views, and the Thesis document.

The Code was written in Microchip studio in C. I have included my code but the USB library has not been attached since its not mine.
